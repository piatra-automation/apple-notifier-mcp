# DXT Icon

This extension includes a notification icon. Since we can't create an actual PNG file through text, you should add a proper icon.png file (64x64 or 128x128 pixels) to represent the extension in Claude Desktop.

A good icon would be:
- A macOS notification bubble
- A bell icon
- An Apple logo with notification badge
- Something that represents macOS notifications

You can create this using any graphics software or find a suitable icon online.
